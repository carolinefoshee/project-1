OUR Summarizes of our findings.
Our findings summarizes that sertain effects on health will affact the cost of health insurance while other factors may have less of a impact on cost.
The Most impactful factors in the risk factores that come with smoking, and the risk factores that come with a high BMI.
The lesser factors is age, and number of childern. 
Stuides show that smoking is the most impactful due to the major health concers with smoking. Smoking has been link to major health issues
such as various cancers, respiratory Problems, Heart Disease, Lung Diseases and more sesceptiable to infections, and weaken immune system. 
Studies show that having a high BMI also can lead to major health concers. These include type-2 Diabetes, Heart Disease and Stoke, High blood pressure,
sleep Apnea, joint problems, and Mental Health. Other factors such as age do play a role however, seen on slide 16. Young non-smokers, with a low BMI 
tend to pay less then 5,000 (20 years of age) and older (60 years of age) pay slightly above 10,000. 




OUR QUESTIONS
How accurately can we predict insurance costs? (regression)
Which factors are most closely associated with insurance costs? (correlations)
What features of the different US regions influence health outcomes and/or insurance costs? (i.e. temperature, climate, population, education)
Which independent variables are correlated with each other? (i.e. age and smoking, region of the US and # of kids, region of the US and smoking habits, BMI and smoking habits, gender and BMI, etc)
