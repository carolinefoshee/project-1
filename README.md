# PROJECT 1 - WHAT DETERMINES HEALTH INSURANCE COST

TEAM MEMBERS: Caroline Foshee, Christian Zaner, Sivangi Raychoudhury

We have been given a task of finding a good dataset for our project and do further calculations and analysis on that dataset. For this purpose we decided to use Kaggel.com and found the dataset of our interest. The link to our dataset .csv file is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance 

PROJECT OBJECTIVE
The main aim of this project is to predict medical costs charged by health insurance companies based on various factors and also to analyse how these factors are related to the medical charges. Here the independent features are age, gender, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking status and region. The dependent feature is medical costs charged by insurance company which is labelled as charges. We reaised the following questions from the dataset, which was our aim.
1. Which independent variables are correlated with each other?
2. Which factors influence insurance cost the most?
3. Why these factors influence the insurance cost? 

STEP 1
After the .csv file got downloaded from Kaggel.com, we imported the csv into pandas dataframe, using Python Pandas library and Jupyter notebook. Other required dependencies are imported too at this point of time.
